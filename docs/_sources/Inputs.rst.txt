Input Data Details
------------------

**Upon instantiating the `Inventory_Loss_Link` class, users may opt to download sample data to test the code. These samples also serve as references for the required data format.**

The Inventory-Loss Link model operates with four main inputs:

1. **Building Inventory**
   - The inventory must contain valid geopolygon geometries under the `"geometry"` column and be in either `.parquet` or `.shp` format.
   - Inventories with missing values are not recommended; such entries may be dropped during processing.
   - The inventory should include columns that specify the following attributes:
     1. Whether a building is wooden,
     2. Whether the residence is single-family,
     3. Whether there is an attached garage,
     4. Building stories (at least a distinction between 1- and 2-story buildings),
     5. Distance to the coastline (for North Carolina),
     6. Year the structure was built.
   - All these columns may solely contain the desired attribute.
   - These columns can have arbitrary names and labels; users can define their mappings when calling the appropriate functions (see :ref:`class-section`).

2. **Damage Lookup Table**
   - If the damage lookup tables are generated using the CHEER-Safe model, users simply need to copy them into the `CHEER_Safe_data` folder (see the :ref:`dir-section`).
   - Based on the component-based loss calculation approach in CHEER-Safe, these tables map combinations of `[M, C]` and `[Wind_ID, Flood_ID]` to damage probabilities across 50 damage states.
   - For more details, refer to the [CHEER-Safe GitHub page](https://github.com/CHEER-Hub/LossModel).

3. **Hazard Data**
   - Given the hurricane-centric nature of the CHEER-Safe model, hazard data must include at least:
     - A column for wind speed
     - A column for flood depth
   - The exact names of these columns can be specified by the user when calling the relevant functions.
   - Hazard data must be placed inside the `Hazards` folder in the `Inventory_Loss_Link` directory (see the :ref:`dir-section`). Each hazard scenario should be contained within a single folder and consist of one or more shapefiles.
   - The folder name will be used later in the code to reference the specific hazard dataset.

4. **Zones (Optional)**
   - Zones are single `.shp` or `.parquet` files containing one or more polygons representing geographic zones.
   - Each file should include the entire zone system (i.e., not one file per polygon).
   - The `Zones` folder is designated for storing zone files. Users can refer to each file by the name they assigned during import.
