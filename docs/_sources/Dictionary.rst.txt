Field Descriptions
==================

The following describes the attributes associated with various checkpoints for which FORTUNA stores data. It is worth mentioning that FORTUNA derives some features directly from public sources, while it also produces additional attributes exclusively within the framework. We label the former as *external* and the latter as *internal*.

For external sources, a stand-alone data dictionary is often provided by the source organization. We refer to those when appropriate, but a more concise version is also included here for completeness.

In the "Data Type" column, we indicate whether each feature is *Original*—i.e., derived directly from actual data records—or *Estimated*, meaning that parametric models were used to infer or impute the values. While this distinction is reliable for internal attributes, for external sources, it is based on our best understanding of their documentation (sometimes marked by ? if vague). Users are advised to consult the original documentation when in doubt.
