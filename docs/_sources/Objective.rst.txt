Objective
---------

The objective of the **Inventory–Loss Link** module is to integrate building-level inventories with the damage probability outputs generated by `CHEER-Safe <https://github.com/CHEER-Hub/LossModel>`_, enabling loss estimation across multiple spatial resolutions — including individual structures and aggregated geographic zones.
